I am a PhD student at Stanford University working with Prof. Mark Cutkosky. My research interest is in robot grasping and in-hand manipulation. Particularly, I am interested in making robots more capable and usable in home settings by leveraging contact with the environment.

Previously, I worked as a Robotics System Engineer at Flexiv Robotics making torque-controlled robot arm for industrial automation. I finished my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering in Stanford and B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley.

I'm originally from Chile, from a small city in the north called Iquique (I've been told it looks like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&tbm=isch&as_q=iquique+cerro+dragon" target="blank">Tatooine</a>). Outside of work I like to spend my free time going on fishing trips, baking bread and getting some fresh air on a hiking trail..
