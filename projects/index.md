Here is a sample of some projects I've worked on in the past years (ordered chronologically) and largely collabortively developed with friends. Some were part of my undergradute courses or graduate courses while others were developed during hackathons or on my spare time.

I hope these projects showcase my passion for building integrated systems that involve both hardware and software solutions; and in some ways how it deeply motivates my research goals of advancing accessibility in design and making. If you're short on time, one of my absolute favorite projects to work on has been the Interactive Flipbooks and the Audio-Tactile Voltmeter created with the Blind Arduino community.
