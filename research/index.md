My research interests are primarily in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction and Accessibility. Through a combination of iterative prototyping and human centered design, I am developing workflows to support spatial information access for people who are blind. Through more controlled studies, I look to understand human perception to inform the design of these new interfaces.
