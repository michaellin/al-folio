I am a researcher with 8+ years of experience in robotics and AI. My expertise lies in the intersection between robot tactile perception, dynamics and robot control. I leverage a diverse set of skills from machine learning to hardware design to come up with creative technical solutions.

I obtained my PhD from Stanford University where I was part of the [Biomimetric and Dexterous Manipulation Lab](http://bdml.stanford.edu/), advised by Prof. Mark Cutkosky. I was a Research Intern at the [NVIDIA Seattle Robotics Lab](https://nvidia_srl.gitlab.io) where I investigated methods to transfer robot skills learned in simulation to the real world (sim2real) by making simulator dynamics more realistic. 
Prior to my PhD, I was a Robotics System Engineer at [Flexiv Robotics Inc.](https://www.flexiv.com) developing the mechatronics and controls of a 7 degrees-of-freedom torque-controlled robot arm for industrial task automation. I completed my undergraduate in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) with a focus in mechatronics and signals and systems.
