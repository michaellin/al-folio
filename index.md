My research focuses on how to enable robots to use the sense of touch to execute tasks more effectively in unstructured settings such as our homes. I develop robots and tactile sensors with the goal of facilitating perception of the environment through contacts. This includes design of robot end-effectors or sensors that can safely and quickly make contact with light objects, to algorithms that are able to integrate sensor information through time to make sense of the environment with the goal of grasping and exploration in clutter. 

I am part of the [Biomimetric and Dexterous Manipulation Lab](http://bdml.stanford.edu/), advised by Prof. Mark Cutkosky. I am also currently part of the [NVIDIA Seattle Robotics Lab](https://nvidia_srl.gitlab.io) where I am investigating methods to transfer robot skills learned in simulation to the real world (sim2real) by making simulator dynamics more realistic. 
Prior to my PhD, I was a Robotics System Engineer at [Flexiv Robotics Inc.](https://www.flexiv.com) developing the mechatronics and controls of a 7 degrees-of-freedom torque-controlled robot arm for industrial task automation. I completed my undergraduate in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) with a focus in mechatronics and signals and systems.
