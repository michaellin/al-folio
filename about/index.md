title: About
---

I am a PhD Student at Stanford University, part of [shape lab](http://shape.stanford.edu) and the [Stanford HCI Group](https://hci.stanford.edu/). My [research interests](research/) are primarily in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction and Accessibility. I am interested in the design of physical interfaces that leverage multimodal perception to make spatial information more accessible for people who are blind. In particular, I am interested in furthering accessibility in three application areas: design tools, collaboration tools, and information visualization. I love design and making things, and I hope my work can help empower others in the same way it inspires me.

Previously, I completed my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering also at Stanford and my B.S. in [Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech](https://bme.gatech.edu) with a minor in Computer Science. 

Three things I enjoy outside academics:
- my home in Panama
- the ocean
- outdoors hiking
