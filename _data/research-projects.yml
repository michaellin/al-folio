    description: >-
        We present a new gripper and exploration approach that uses an exploratory finger with very low 
        reflected inertia for probing and grasping objects quickly and safely in unstructured environments. 
        Equipped with sensing and force control, the gripper allows a robot to leverage contact information 
        to accurately estimate object location through a particle filtering algorithm and also grasp objects 
        with location uncertainty based on a contact-first approach.
        This publication is still under review so it is not yet available, but you can check out the video for
        more information.

-   title: '(In review) A Stretchable Tactile Sleeve for Reaching into Cluttered Spaces'
    authors: 'Alexander M. Gruebele, Michael A. Lin, Dane Brouwer, Shenli Yuan, Andrew Zerbe and Mark R. Cutkosky'
    description: >-
        A highly conformable stretchable sensory
        skin made entirely of soft components. The skin uses
        pneumatic taxels and stretchable channels to conduct pressure
        signals to off-board MEMs pressure sensors. The skin is able
        to resolve forces down to 0.01N and responds to vibrations
        up to 200 Hz. We apply the skin to a 2 degree-of-freedom robotic
        wrist with intersecting axes for manipulation in constrained
        spaces, and show that it has sufficient sensitivity and bandwidth
        to detect the onset of sliding as the robot contacts objects. We
        demonstrate the skin in object acquisition tasks in a tightly
        constrained environment for which extraneous contacts are unavoidable.
