        This work presents the design and modelling of whisker-inspired sensors that attach to 
        the surface of a robot manipulator to sense its surrounding through light contacts. 
        We obtain a sensor model using a calibration process that applies to straight and curved whiskers. 
        We then propose a sensing algorithm using Bayesian filtering to localize contact points. 
        The algorithm combines the accurate proprioceptive sensing of the robot and sensor readings from 
        the deflections of the whiskers. Our results show that our algorithm is able to track contact points 
        with sub-millimeter accuracy, outperforming a baseline method. Finally, we demonstrate our sensor 
        and perception method in a real-world system where a robot moves in between free-standing objects 
        and uses the whisker sensors to track contacts tracing object contours.

    authors: 'Michael A. Lin, Rachel Thomasson, Gabriela Uribe, Hojung Choi and Mark R. Cutkosky'
    description: >-
        We present a new gripper and exploration approach that uses an exploratory finger with very low 
        reflected inertia for probing and grasping objects quickly and safely in unstructured environments. 
        Equipped with sensing and force control, the gripper allows a robot to leverage contact information 
        to accurately estimate object location through a particle filtering algorithm and also grasp objects 
        with location uncertainty based on a contact-first approach.
        This publication is still under review so it is not yet available.

-   title: 'A Stretchable Tactile Sleeve for Reaching into Cluttered Spaces'
    authors: 'Alexander M. Gruebele, Michael A. Lin, Dane Brouwer, Shenli Yuan, Andrew Zerbe and Mark R. Cutkosky'
    description: >-
        A highly conformable stretchable sensory
        skin made entirely of soft components. The skin uses
        pneumatic taxels and stretchable channels to conduct pressure
        signals to off-board MEMs pressure sensors. The skin is able
        to resolve forces down to 0.01N and responds to vibrations
        up to 200 Hz. We apply the skin to a 2 degree-of-freedom robotic
        wrist with intersecting axes for manipulation in constrained
        spaces, and show that it has sufficient sensitivity and bandwidth
        to detect the onset of sliding as the robot contacts objects. We
        demonstrate the skin in object acquisition tasks in a tightly
        constrained environment for which extraneous contacts are unavoidable.
