-   title: "Physical Manipulation of Virtual Holograms Using Proxies"
    date: "Spring 2017"
    description: >-
        CS 231A Computer Vision course project. Made a probabilistic 
        Bayesian model to process RGB-D camera frames and find the object 
        most similar to a virtual 3D model. The goal was to use this 
        method in Augmented Reality such that a uesr can find an object 
        in his/her surroundings of similar shape to a hologram and use it as 
        proxy to manipulate the holograms pose.

        The TouchMusic glove is a wearable gadget that enables a 
        music lover to physically experience their favorite songs. 
        The glove does this by decoding a song's rhythm and melody to 
        construct patterns to vibrate into the hand.
