-   title: "Natural Language Processing: More Abstractive Summarization with
Pointer-Generator Networks"

        Course: CS224N Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning.
        We investigate how to improve on existing neural network approaches to perform abstractive text summarization. One particular challenge 
        is that handling of out-of-vocabulary words, especially with the use of pointer generator networks, causes the network to copy words and sentences 
        from the input excessively resulting in less abstractiveness (i.e. generation of novel text). We formulate a new training method that penalizes on word copying 
        and the resulting model produces significantly more novel n-grams (at least 30% increase) than the baseline model while having comparable performance in terms 
        of ROUGE scores.

    date: "Spring 2017"
    description: >-
        Course: CS 231A Computer Vision course project. Made a probabilistic 
        Bayesian model to process RGB-D camera frames and find the object 
        most similar to a virtual 3D model. The goal was to use this 
        method in Augmented Reality such that a uesr can find an object 
        in his/her surroundings of similar shape to a hologram and use it as 
        proxy to manipulate the holograms pose.

        Course: ME 218C Smart Product Design.
        Designed a remote-controlled hovercraft to compete in the course's final tournament. The goal of the tournament was to drive your hovercraft around collecting ping-pong balls and throwing them into the opponents goal. A bonus of the project was to design the controller such that the player looked silly when sending commands.

        Course: ME 218B Smart Product Design.
        Designed a smart mobile robot to navigate through a field using electromagnetic sensors and race the opponent in a zone-capture game. Each team's car had to go to map coordinates and send a RF request to capture the zone and had the option to shoot a ball to a bucket to disable the opponent.

        Course: ME 218A Smart Product Design.
        Designed a two-player arcade game where players interact with different electro-mechanical interfaces and worked together to score points and "stop the leak". One player turned a wrench in a specified pattern and another player moved a bucket to catch the water drops.

        Hackathon: LAHacks 2015. The TouchMusic glove is a wearable gadget that enables a 
        music lover to physically experience their favorite songs. 
        The glove does this by decoding a song's rhythm and melody to 
        construct patterns to vibrate into the hand.

        Course: EE192 Mechatronics Design Lab. 
        This course focused on applying concepts such as digital signal processing, controls and circuits into a hands-on team project. The course finished with a course competition followed by the NATCAR race. Throughout the course we built a line-following race RC car using a line-array camera, custom-made motor board and preciously tuned racing control algorithm. My team placed first in the NATCAR competition with an average speed of 9.06 feet/s

        Course: EE128 Feedback Control Systems. 
        This course covered topics such as root locus, Bode and Nyquist plot, Laplace transforms, State-space control and LQR. The labs had fun components such as designing a PID controller for a mini mag-lev system and a non-linear controller to balance an inverted pendulum.
