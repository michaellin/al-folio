    description: >-
        We have developed a mixed-reality system that projects a 3D “hologram” of images 
        from a breast MRI onto a patient using the Microsoft HoloLens. The goal of this 
        system is to reduce the number of repeated surgeries by improving surgeons’ ability 
        to determine tumor extent. We are conducting a pilot study in patients with palpable 
        tumors that tests a surgeon’s ability to accurately identify the tumor location via 
        mixed-reality visualization during surgical planning

    description: >-
        A MR-compatible biopsy needle stylet is instrumented with optical fibers that provide information about 
        contact conditions between the needle tip and organs or hard tissues such as bone or tumors. This information 
        is rendered via a haptic display that uses ultrasonic motors to convey directional cues to users. Lateral haptic 
        cues at the fingertips improve the targeting accuracy and success rate in penetrating a prostate phantom.

-   title: 'The Effect of Manipulator Gripper Stiffness on Teleoperated Task Performance'
    authors: 'Michael A. Lin, Samuel B. Schorr, Iris Yan and Allison M. Okamura'

    description: >-
        The absence of environment force sensing in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, makes it challenging for surgeons to 
        perform tasks while applying a controlled force to not damage patient tissue. One way to help modulate grip force is to use 
        a passive spring to resist the closing of the master-side gripper of the teleoperated system. To investigate the effect of this
        spring stiffness we developed a haptic device that can render a programmed gripper stiffnesses. We conducted a study in which subjects 
        used our dvice to teleoperate a Raven II surgical robotic system in a pick-and-place task. We found that increasing the gripper stiffness
        resulted in reduced forces applied at the slave-side.
